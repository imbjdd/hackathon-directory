2. Add a new entry following this format:

```yaml

  location: [Location or "Online"]
  status: [Upcoming or Completed]
  category: [Blockchain, AI, General, etc.]
  prize: [Prize amount or ""]

```

### Example:

```yaml

  location: San Francisco, USA
  status: Upcoming
  category: General
  prize: 50k$
  website: https://example.com/devfest2025
```

### Field Guidelines:

- **id**: A unique identifier for the hackathon (use lowercase, no spaces)
- **name**: The official name of the hackathon
- **date**: Use format "Month Day-Day, Year" or "Month Day, Year"
- **location**: City, Country or "Online"
